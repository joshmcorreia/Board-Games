# Monopoly Deal Clarifications

1. Adding a Hotel to a property with a House already on it means that rent will now cost as much as the Hotel and House combined (+$7M), the Hotel does not replace the House.
2. If you use a "Just Say No" card when rent is played, only your rent is cancelled. All other players still have to pay rent.
3. If you run out of cards in the draw pile, shuffle the discard pile and move them to the draw pile. This will become the new draw pile.
