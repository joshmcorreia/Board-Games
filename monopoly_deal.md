# Monopoly Deal Clarifications

1. Adding a Hotel to a property with a House already on it means that rent will now cost as much as the Hotel and House combined (+$7M), the Hotel does not replace the House.
2. If you use a "Just Say No" card when rent is played, only your rent is cancelled. All other players still have to pay rent.
